Pro Basketball Pocket Reference (PBPR) by Nick Santaniello

The Pro Basketball Pocket Reference (PBPR for short) is a simple, easy-to-use sports reference app for iOS devices.

It's written in Lua, intended for use with the Corona SDK. 

The main program is main.lua. From there, alternate 'screens' are summoned and take the form of additional '.lua' files such as players.lua, teams.lua, etc.

Aside from using the Corona SDK, PBPR also uses Corona's 'Storyboard API' for changing scenes easily and Corona's widget library to provide native iOS elements.
